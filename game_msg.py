Hello Everyone!! Welcome to our Angel and Mortal Game AY2223 S2! üòá

Our angel mortal will run from 31st January to 13th February, so ideally give 1 gift each week 

Here are the rules

1. You get assigned 1 angel and 1 mortal 

2. Your angel is the person who sayang/take care of you, give you gifts and makes sure the next few weeks aren‚Äôt complete pain :‚Äù) or be the one who PRANKS you

3. Your mortal is the person YOU sayang/take care of, give them gifts and make sure they stay alive for the next few weeks or the person you pull PRANKS on

4. Pls don‚Äôt accidentally reveal your identity to your mortal in a dumb way like PM-ing them :‚Äù) if they figure it out themselves that‚Äôs cool but ya if you got anything to tell them can pm @yeo_menghan and he‚Äôll forward your message to them!

5. For those not on campus, fret not! You can contact @yeo_menghan to help deliver your gifts to your mortal and likewise from your angel

For this iteration, we're limiting PRANKING within RC4 ONLY as part of trialing the new initiative and to ensure the same level of enthusiasm is matched amongst those participating.

Also!! V impt!!! GIVE LETTERS AND NOTES TGT WITH YOUR GIFTS üéÅü•∫ rmb that angel mortal is for yall to get to know each other better and make new frens (from diff batches/diff residences!), and also to have an excuse to make/buy things üíå Youre highly encouraged to leave notes for your angels also (like just leave it at your door to take the next time they come by) then you can make double the number of friends HAHAHA
